- R programming for operations research


### 3. House price prediction model - PYTHON
In this project a linear regression analysis on the Kings County Housing Data is performed. The goal is to explore the dataset and generate a model to predict the price of Houses in Kings County in Washington State. This analysis and the results that follow is of importance to homeowners, realtors and other stakeholders in the King County Housing Market.
